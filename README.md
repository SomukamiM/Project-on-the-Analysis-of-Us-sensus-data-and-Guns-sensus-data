#  Analysis of US Census  data and Gun Census data

## Dataset

The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov.



## Summary of Findings

From the guns dataset i have found that most people have long guns in america as compared to hand guns. North carolina had the highest number of guns while Mariana Islands,Virgin Islands'District of Columbia and Guam have the lowest totals. Also north carolina has the highest number of permits for guns.

  From Us censuc data North Carolina had a population increase from 2010 to 2016 Census. Most firms in that state are owned by men from the 2012 census. majority of the firms are owned by non minorities in that state. Athough veterans own firms in the state they own the least number of firms as compared to non veterans. Minorities are a very small part of north carolina population so it seems that gun ownership is prevalent with non minority people as that state has very few non minorities.
